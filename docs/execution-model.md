# Execution Model

SPL follows a layered execution model.

## Execution Layers

1. Source Text
2. Token Stream
3. Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
4. Semantic / Intent Graph
5. Execution Engine

## Execution Engine Types

- Interpreter
- Compiler backend
- AI-assisted executor (future)

## Determinism

By default, SPL execution is deterministic.
Non-deterministic behavior must be explicitly declared.

## Future Extensions

- Symbolic execution
- Partial evaluation
- AI-guided optimization
