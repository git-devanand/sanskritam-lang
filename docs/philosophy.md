# Design Philosophy

Modern programming languages optimize for hardware efficiency and developer convenience.
SPL optimizes for **meaning**.

## Core Principles

### 1. Intent over Instructions

Programs should describe *what* is intended, not just *how* to execute.

### 2. Semantic Explicitness

All constructs must have clearly defined semantics, minimizing ambiguity.

### 3. AI-Native Design

The language should be:

- Readable by humans
- Reasonable by machines
- Interpretable by AI systems

### 4. Research First

SPL prioritizes correctness, clarity, and extensibility over backward compatibility.

### 5. Execution as Interpretation

Execution is treated as interpretation of symbolic intent, not just instruction dispatch.
