# System Architecture

SPL is structured as a modular language system.

## Core Modules

- Lexer
- Parser
- AST
- Semantic Analyzer
- Runtime / VM
- Tooling Layer

## Architectural Goals

- Replaceable components
- Clear abstraction boundaries
- Research-friendly modularity

Each module can evolve independently without breaking the language core.
