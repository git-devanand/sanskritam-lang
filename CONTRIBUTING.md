## 🧩 Project Philosophy

Before contributing, please align with SPL’s core principles:

- **Meaning over syntax**
- **Semantics over sequence**
- **Graphs over linear code**
- **AI-first design**
- **Inclusivity through multilingual computing**

Contributions that conflict with these principles may not be accepted.

## 🧪 Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Prefer **clarity over cleverness**
- Use descriptive names
- Comment semantic decisions clearly
- Follow modern C++ standards (C++20 preferred)

### Commits

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages following conventional commit standards.
- One logical change per commit.

Example:
```text
feat(compiler): Add semantic dependency graph resolver
```

## Delopment Workflow


### 1️⃣ Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button on GitHub and clone your fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sanskritam-lang.git
cd sanskritam-lang
```

2️⃣ Create a Branch

Use a descriptive branch name
```
git checkout -b feature/grammar-enhancement
```
Examples:

feature/parser-improvement

fix/tokenizer-bug

docs/language-guide

research/execution-model

3️⃣ Make Your Changes

Guidelines:

Keep commits focused and meaningful

Follow existing folder structure

Add comments where logic is non-trivial

Prefer clarity over cleverness

Write test cases if applicable

4️⃣ Commit Messages

Use clear, conventional commit messages:
```
feat: add pattern matching construct
fix: resolve ambiguity in loop grammar
docs: improve language overview
research: refine execution model
```

5️⃣ Submit a Pull Request

Push your branch to your fork

Open a Pull Request against main

Clearly describe:

What problem it solves

Why the change is needed

Any breaking changes

A maintainer will review your PR and may request changes.
